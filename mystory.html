This is my developer story.

<ul>As a child, there was no computer or even cell-phone in the family.</ul>
<ul>In the high School, we had few computers for Computer Lab Class for the whole school, and I had only two Lab classes in the the whole School year to learn how turn-on and off a PC, how to search on an Internet Explorer,  how to access Microsoft word and excel, and saving files on the PC.</ul>
<ul>In college I had a little better access to computers in the college's Library where I used to read more information when I had assignments even though there was little Internet service and  access.</ul>

<ul>After I had arrived in the USA, I started going to the Public library. I was able to use the computer for an hour at a time, and there I started teaching myself the basics of a computer, how to make a resume,  and how to print documents.
I always had an interest and love for technology, so I bought my first Laptop called Toshiba Satellite.</ul
<ul>Now, I joined this great Refcode community in 2022, to learn more about Software Engineering where my dream is always building Software as a software engineer.<<ul>
