<h4>This is my developer story.</h4>

<ul>
  <ul>
    As a child, there was no computer or even cell-phone in the family.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    In the high School, we had few computers for Computer Lab class for the
    whole school, and I had only two Lab classes in the the whole school year to
    learn how turn-on and off a PC, how to search on an Internet Explorer, how
    to use Microsoft word and excel, and saving files.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    In the college, I had a better access to computers at the college's library
    where I used to use computers to gather more information when I had
    assignments.
  </ul>

  <ul>
    After I had arrived in the USA, I started going to the Public library where
    I had more access to use the computer for an hour at a time, and there I
    started teaching myself the basics of a computer.
    <ul>
      I always had an interest and love for technology, so I bought my first
      Laptop called Toshiba-Satellite.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Currently, I joined this great Refcode community in 2022, to learn more
      about Software Engineering where my dream is always as being a Software
      Enginee.
