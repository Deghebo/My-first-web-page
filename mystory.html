<h1><u>My story</u></h1>
<h2><i>Chalew Deghebo</i></h2>

<h3>This is my developer story.</h3>

<ul><b>
  <ul>
    As a child, there was no computer or even cell-phone in the family.
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ul>
    In the high School, we had few computers for Computer Lab class for the
    whole school, and I had only two Lab classes the whole school year to
    learn; <br> turning-on and off a PC, how to search on an Internet Explorer, how
    to use Microsoft word and excel, and saving files.
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ul>
    In the college, I had a better access to computers at the college's library
    where I used to use computers to gather more information when I had
    assignments.
  </ul>
<br>
  <ul>
    After I had arrived in the USA, I started going to the Public library where
    I had more access to use the computer for about an hour at a time. 
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ul>I always had an interest and love for technology. <br>
    The first P.C I bought was called called Toshiba-Satellite.
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ul>Currently, I joined Refcode community in 2022 to learn more
      about Software Engineering where my dream is always being a Software
      Engineer.
