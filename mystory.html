        <h2><u>My Story</u></h2>
        <h3><i>My name is Chalew Deghebo</i></h3>

        <h4>This is my developer story:</h4>

        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> As a child, there was no computer or even cell-phone in the
                family.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In the high School, we had few computers for Computer Lab class
                for the
                whole school, and I had few Lab classes where I was thought just
                the basics or introduction
                <br> to turn on and off a computer, using Internet
                Explorer, & some Microsoft word, excel, and saving files.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In the college, I had a better access to computers at the
                college's
                library
                where I used to use computers to search and read some
                informations.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                After I had arrived in the USA, I had better access to the
                Internet and
                computers in the Public library.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>I always had an interest and love for technology. <br>
                The first P.C I bought was called called Toshiba-Satellite.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Currently, I joined Refcode community with the <em>2022-Spring-cohort
                    training</em> to learn more
                about Software Engineering where my dream is always being a
                Software
                Engineer.
            </li>
        </ul>
