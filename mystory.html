      <p> As a child, there was no computer or even cell-phone in the
        family.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the high School, we had few computers for Computer Lab
        class
        for the
        whole school, and I had few Lab classes where I was thought
        just
        the basics or introduction to turn on and off a computer,
        using
        Internet
        Explorer, & some Microsoft word, excel, and saving files.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        In the college, I had a better access to computers at the
        college's
        library
        where I used to use computers to search and read some
        informations.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I had arrived in the USA, I had better access to the
        Internet and
        computers in the Public library.
      </p><br>
      <p>I always had an interest and love for technology. <br>
        The first P.C was Toshiba-Satellite.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Currently, I joined <b>Refcode Lab community</b> in the <b>2022-Spring-cohort
          training.</b> </p> <br>
      <p>Currently I am learning lots of valuable
        knowledges
        about Software Engineering where my dream is always being a
        Software Engineer.</p> <br>
